BREAKDOWN of project approach

1) Page 1 css, html
    build the first page [appts homepage]
2) jquery to show page 2
    Add jquery onlick.plus = show page two
3) css + html for page 2
    when they click replace the html with other html
4) jquery to show page 1 when save or back
    jquery back to the last page
5) X button click listener
    put click listener on x button
    to create a modal
    append below HTML to pop up
    <div class="prompt">
    <span class="prompt-message">are you sure?</span>
    <button class="prompt-delete">delete</button>
    <button class="prompt-cancel">cancel</button>
    </div>

RESPONSIBILITIES

Main Screen
- Show appointments
- The abilities to changes pages (add new, edit)
- Remove appt
- Confirmation prompt
  - confirm
  - cancel

New Appointment
- Go back to list view
- Create appointment
- Add new appt to list to appointment store

Show Details
- Go back
- edit
- delete

- appointment store
- appointment class





Different files
- show-appointments.js
-


Steps to first check-in
1) create a js file that declares the global variable
    var app = {}

2) make appointment.js file to hold your appointment object
    //The appointment constructor creates a new appt
    app.Appointment = function (spec) {
    //TODO: construct an appointment from spec
    };

3) make appointment-store.js file

    app.AppointmentStore = function() {

    //TODO:  implement the appt store here
    // should have these properties
    // add(appointment)
    // removebyID(appointmentID)
    // query()
};

4) make list-appointments-screen.js file
    Purpose is to manage the first page screen (list view)


5) make page-switcher.js file
    app.PageSwitcher = function () {


    registerPage(name, callback)
    goToPage(name)

}


so it will flow in HTML like:
jquery
app.js
appointment-store.js
appointment.js



Next steps:

Bobby:
- what goes in form into an object (newAppointment)
- being able to make that display

Grace:
- get edit and new form to work together
- lo dash
- delete button
